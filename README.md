# FinancialMarketNoDB

Hi, this is my simulated financial market based on the auction model that implements some AI trading strategies on top of it.

This is the simplified version of the market that has no database attached

Alternatively, to run the market with a MySQL database, checkout https://github.com/samrudd1/FinancialMarket

to run the market, start the main method in src/main/java/trade/RunMarket and remember to build the project with the pom.xml file to have all dependencies installed.

Thanks for checking my project out!
